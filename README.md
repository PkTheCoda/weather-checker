# Weather Checker App!
Live Demo: https://pkthecoda.github.io/weather-checker/

This was a simple tool that I made that allow the user to enter in any state, city, or zipcode and the site will show them all the relevant weather-details about the place they entered. Take a look:

<h2>Beginning Screen</h2>
This is where you'll enter in the city/zipcode you would like to take a look at. For the purposes of this example, I decided to put in "london"

<h2>Details Screen:</h2>
It might take a few seconds since I am pulling the information from an API, but once fully loading, you may see something like this:

You can see everything from the temperatures for the next few days to the region to even wind speed, local time, etc. If you want to search for something new, you can do it at the bottom:

What I learned in JavaScript while making this project:
- Async and await
- Using fetch()
- Asynchronous Code
- Promises (resolve, reject)
- Try/Catch Blocks
- JSON (using it, parsing it)
- Refreshed on factory functions, constructors

What I learned in HTML/CSS while making this project:
- Refreshed on CSS grid
- Learned how to use animations and effects in CSS
- Practiced Responsive Design
- HTML Tables (Never ended up using them, but was still interesting nevertheless)

Overall I had a ton of fun creating this project. I made it during school over the course of two days and learned so many new things about web development in general. I definitely plan to continue using APIs to make some new things in the future!

In the future, I do plan to add new features in the future like:

- local storage
- Convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Better UI revamp

Thanks for checking it out! Any feedback would be great.
